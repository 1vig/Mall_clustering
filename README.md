# Mall Customer Clustering

This project aims to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographic details using clustering techniques. The dataset includes various features such as age, income, and spending scores. The goal is to explore the data, apply clustering algorithms, and provide insights into customer segments.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure and distribution of the data, and identify key features that influence customer segmentation.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that could improve the clustering results.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Apply clustering algorithms to segment customers into different groups.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the clustering models using appropriate metrics and refine them for better segmentation.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to showcase the insights and results of the clustering analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features of mall customers, such as:
- Customer ID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Other relevant features

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis, clustering, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For applying clustering algorithms and evaluating models.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/1vig/mall-customer-clustering.git
    cd mall-customer-clustering
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks** to explore the data, apply clustering algorithms, and visualize results:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Results

The project demonstrates the process of clustering mall customers using various clustering algorithms. The results include:
- Data visualizations that highlight trends and insights from the dataset.
- Customer segments with descriptive statistics and characteristics.
- A detailed analysis of the factors influencing customer segmentation.
